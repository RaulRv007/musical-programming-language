# üéµ BitSonata

*A programming language where code is composed like music.*

---

**BitSonata** is an almost **Turing-complete programming language** based entirely on musical structure. In BitSonata, writing a program means composing a song. Variables, expressions, control flow, and logic are expressed through **melody, rhythm, harmony, and musical motifs**.

Inspired by music theory and powered by abstract syntax trees, BitSonata is designed to be **interpreted, expressive, and musical** ‚Äî your code doesn't just run‚Ä¶ it plays.

## üéØ Goal
To mix 2 of my passions, coding and music. Trying to turn computer science into art, and being able to enjoy CS 

## ‚ú® Features

- **üóùÔ∏è Key-based scope:** The code is key based, so it can be played in every possible instrument. It is possible to write the same code in 2 completly different keys
- **üé∂ Variable declarations via rhythmic motifs.**
- **üîÅ Loops, conditions, and logic** built from cadences, intervals, and phrasing.
- **üß† Melodic arithmetic:** Ascending = addition, descending = subtraction, and more.
- **üéº Readable and musical output** ‚Äî you can literally listen to your code.

## üìú How to use?

Follow these steps to get started with BitSonata:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitsonata.git
    cd bitsonata
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Compose your code**
    - Use [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) or your preferred music notation software to compose your program as a music sheet or MIDI file.
    - Save your composition in one of the supported formats (`.mxl`, `.musicxml`, `.xml`, `.mid`, `.midi`).

4. **Run the interpreter**
    ```bash
    python interpreter.py "path/to/your/music_sheet_or_midi"
    ```
    Replace `"path/to/your/music_sheet_or_midi"` with the actual path to your file.

5. **Listen and enjoy**
    - The interpreter will process your musical code and execute it.
    - You can listen to your code and see the output in your terminal.

**Example:**
```bash
python interpreter.py "examples/hello_world.mxl"
```

> üí° *Tip: Try composing simple melodies to get started, then experiment with more complex musical structures to explore the full power of BitSonata!*



## üìÇ File Extension

Use for your BitSonata files:
- `.mxl`  
- `.musicxml`
- `.xml`
- `.mid`
- `.midi`


```
my_composition.mxl
```
It's been mainly tested with `.mxl`

## üì¶ Coming Soon

- More freesom when composing
- Live interpreter with MIDI output
- Audio input for live performances (vibe coding at its mamximum exponent)
- Visual editor for composing, turns the music into pseudocode so it is easier to code
- Improve lexer so it allows more modes than major and minor
- More examples
- Web interpreter so everybody can use it online
- Company website
