# 🎵 BitSonata

*A programming language where code is composed like music.*

---

**BitSonata** is an almost **Turing-complete programming language** based entirely on musical structure. In BitSonata, writing a program means composing a song. Variables, expressions, control flow, and logic are expressed through **melody, rhythm, harmony, and musical motifs**.

Inspired by music theory and powered by abstract syntax trees, BitSonata is designed to be **interpreted, expressive, and musical** — your code doesn't just run… it plays.

## 🎯 Goal
To mix 2 of my passions, coding and music. Trying to turn computer science into art, and being able to enjoy CS 

## ✨ Features

- **🗝️ Key-based scope:** The code is key based, so it can be played in every possible instrument. It is possible to write the same code in 2 completly different keys
- **🎶 Variable declarations via rhythmic motifs.**
- **🔁 Loops, conditions, and logic** built from cadences, intervals, and phrasing.
- **🧠 Melodic arithmetic:** Ascending = addition, descending = subtraction, and more.
- **🎼 Readable and musical output** — you can literally listen to your code.
